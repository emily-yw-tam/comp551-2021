The notebook file is "551MP2_final.ipynb". All scripts and experiments results are in this file.

We also attached .py scripts for converting .txt files in IMDb data folder to .csv. The output files are: IMDB_training.csv, IMDB_testing.csv, IMDB_training_rating.csv and IMDB_testing_rating.csv.

If you want to run the .py scripts, the "aclImdb" folder should be in the same folder as the scripts.
