# COMP 551 (Winter 2021)

**Instructor:** Reihaneh Rabbany

**Group:** Emily Tam, Alvin Chen, Ziqi Li

This course covers a selected set of topics in machine learning and data mining, with an emphasis on good methods and practices for deployment of real systems. The majority of sections are related to commonly used supervised learning techniques, and to a lesser degree unsupervised methods. This includes fundamentals of algorithms on linear and logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, clustering, neural networks, as well as key techniques for feature selection and dimensionality reduction, error estimation and empirical validation.

### Abstract

The main claim of the paper “Visualizing Data using t-SNE” by Laurens van der Maaten and and Geoffrey Hinton is
that t-SNE, a new technique for visualizing high-dimensional data, produces significantly better maps compared to other
non-parametric visualization techniques. In this project, we reproduced the visualizations of the MNIST dataset from
the paper by Maaten and Hinton using t-SNE, Sammon mapping, isomap, and LLE. We found that it was possible to
reproduce the results from the original paper. We then extended the results of the original paper by exploring different
parameter choices and using the 2D representation of data to train KNN and decision tree models.
