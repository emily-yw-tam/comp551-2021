This course covered a selected set of topics in machine learning and data mining, with an emphasis on good methods and practices for deployment of real systems. The majority of sections were related to commonly used supervised learning techniques, and to a lesser degree unsupervised methods. This includes fundamentals of algorithms on linear and logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, clustering, neural networks, as well as key techniques for feature selection and dimensionality reduction, error estimation and empirical validation.
